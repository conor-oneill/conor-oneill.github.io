      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m an Australian data scientist that wants to help you make more informed decisions.
I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with groups from large multinationals to startups to small internal teams. I help stakeholders understand how they can use data to help solve problems they are facing, design solutions that meet their needs, and execute those solutions.
In a past life I was an astrophysics and cosmology researcher, and am still involved in the field on the side.</description>
