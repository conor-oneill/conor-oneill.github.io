										<p>
											A couple of different ways to display maths equations on a webpage
										</p>
									</header>
									<a href="blog.html#displaying_maths" class="image featured"><img src="images/eulers_identity.svg" alt="eulers_identity" title="Euler's Identity" /></a>
									<h3><small> <i> 10/01/16 </i> </small></h3>
									<p>
										There are plenty of ways to write mathematical equations on a webpage, but I'm used to <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/">Latex</a> and want to display maths as Latex does.
										It's visually pretty, and I'm used to the syntax, making it very easy to display what I want. So how does one display \(\LaTeX\) equations on their webpage?
									</p>
									<p>
										In my quick search I came across a couple of good options. The first, and the one I used on my <a href="projects.html#random_numbers">first project post</a>,
										is <a href="http://www.codecogs.com/">Code Cogs</a>. The other is <a href="https://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a>, which (spoiler) is what I'll be using from now on.

									</p>
									<section>
										<header>
											<h3>Code Cogs</h3>
										</header>
									<p>
										I initially went with CodeCogs because I'd used their <a href="http://www.codecogs.com/latex/eqneditor.php">Equation Editor</a> and so had some familiarity with them,
										and the implentation looked straightforward, whilst I thought MathJax would be trickier (it isn't). The setup for CodeCogs is well explained on their site
										<a href="http://latex.codecogs.com/eqneditor/integration/htmlequations.php">http://latex.codecogs.com/eqneditor/integration/htmlequations.php</a>.
										Using the equation 1+sin(x) as a running example, all you have to do is paste
										\( \texttt{ &lt;img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?1+sin(x)" border="0"/&gt; } \) in the place you want to show the equation. Here's an example
										with <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?1+sin(x)" border="0"/> in the middle of the sentence.
									</p>
									<p>
										Note that the "svg" format may not display
										properly on some versions of Internet Explorer, and one can use "gif" format instead, but at the cost of terrible resolution. Another problem is that the equation
										is displayed as an image, so cannot be highlighted or copy and pasted. Finally, the alignment is funny, sitting above the text, as well as often cutting off the top of 
										an equation with tall characters, such as in <a href="blog.html#displaying_maths">the header image for this post</a>. Using \( \texttt{\inline}\) before the equation
										helps slightly, but not much. When writing my first project post I knew this was not going to be acceptable and to check out MathJax.
									</p>
									</section>
									<section>
										<header>
											<h3>MathJax</h3>
										</header>
									<p>
										I hadn't used MathJax before, but it turns out it's super easy to use and displays very nicely. As it states in <a href="http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/start.html">the documentation</a>,
										simply add 
									</p>
									<p>
										\( \texttt{&lt;script type="text/javascript" async} \)<p>
										</p>\(\texttt{ src="https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML"&gt;}\)</p>
										<p>\(\texttt{&lt;/script&gt;} \)</p>
									</p>
									<p>
										into the \( \texttt{&lt;head&gt;} \) block of the page and you're ready to go.
										Then you just use <b><code>&#36;&#36;eqn here&#36;&#36;</code></b> or <b><code>\[eqn here\]</code></b> for displayed maths, e.g. $$1+sin(x)$$ and
										<b><code>\(eqn here\)</code></b> for inline maths, e.g. \(1+sin(x)\). This is a lot nicer in my opinion, and fixes all the issues talked about for CodeCogs, as well as
										being easier to type when you want to write an equation.
									</p>
									<p>
										A minor point, but MathJax seems to become a bit annoying when trying to display its delimiting characters in math-mode, as I just discovered, which is why those pieces
										of syntax in the last paragraph are just bolded. The earlier ones used the MathJax rendering of the \( \texttt{\texttt{} }\) latex command. There is likely a workaround
										though, since I've just used the most ready-to-use form of MathJax which accesses their site when loading the page. 
									</p>
									</section>
									<p>
										I should point out that both CodeCogs and MathJax have multiple methods of implementation that I didn't mention, so I potentially gave CodeCogs a hard rap
										(although I suspect MathJax would still be better).
									</p>
									<p>
										In related news, I need to get a good way to display code...
									</p>
									<p>
										Anyway, here's a few nicely rendered equations:
									</p>
									<p>
										<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation">Time-Dependent Schr&ouml;dinger Equation</a>:
											$$i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi(\mathbf{r},t) = \hat{H}\Psi(\mathbf{r},t)$$
										<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">Gaussian Distribution</a>:
											$$f(x|\mu,\sigma) = \frac{ 1}{ \sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{ -\frac{ (x-\mu)^2}{ 2\sigma^2} }$$
										<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_field_equations">Einstein Field Equations</a>:
											$$R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2} R g_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu\nu}$$

									<p>
										Finally put some content up! <a href="projects.html#random_numbers">Here's the link</a>! Took a little longer to get everything ready post-new years than I thought it would.
										I've more-or-less just summarised part of an assignment from my Advanced Computational Physics class. It took up more time and space
										than I'd anticipated, so I'm going to add more for that section later (I just want something up!) and potentially add more of
										my work from that course (my original intention). This first one is just a small taste of some underlying theory rather than application.
										The course covered Monte Carlo statistical methods and other numerical simulation techniques, explored stochastic differential equations,
										statistical reliability with regards to random numbers, and applied everything to physical systems.
									</p>
									<p>
										I thought I'd post these to have something on the site and get it started. Whilst they're not dataset exploration, I think
										the concepts are interesting in their own right and still demonstrate some cool techniques.
									</p>
									<p>
										This course is still taught, so I've only used snippets of my assignments and covered the content broadly. I've also
										not shared the C++ code for the same reason.
									</p>
									<p>
										It was an interesting experience to create this first project post, and I've learned a bit more about how I might like to proceed or
										what I might like to change about the site in the future. I'll leave that for another post though.

									<h3><small> <i> 31/12/15 </i> </small></h3>
									<p>
										Making a website that acts as a place to display some of my work, a blog of some type, and 
										a somewhat professional online presence has been something I've been meaning to do for a while now.
										Considering I made an extremely basic old site over a year ago (see <a href="blog.html#first_post_img">image above</a>) just to have somewhere to
										point people if they wanted to see my resume, for example, this should be a good step up.
									</p>

											<h3>Portfolio</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											I'm currently in the awkward spot between career paths. I'd been doing well in the academic world but for various
											reasons have decided to move into industry rather than (or potentially prior to) doing a PhD. There are many
											paths I'm interested in and would be happy moving into, but at the apex is data science, particularly something
											that makes cool and strong use of AI, for a business or cause that I can get excited about. 
										</p>
										<p>
											This career switch has meant a rebranding of my skills which, whilst being very relevant and applicable to
											a wide range of quantitative/analytic roles, are often not immediately recognised by those more used to 
											applicants from other fields. Nevertheless, showcasing some of my work here will allow others to directly
											see what I can do.
										</p>
									</section>
									<section>
										<header>
											<h3>Commitment</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											One of the goals of this site is to make myself commit to regularly analysing public datasets, producing some
											interesting findings, and sharing that online. To that end, I'm going to attempt to average at least
											<b> one <a href="projects.html">'Project'</a> post per week in 2016</b>. 
											This may have any degree of analysis, from basic methods and simple findings, to dwelling deeper and applying
											more sophisticated methods. I'm concurrently taking various online courses via sites like <a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a>,
											mainly in areas specifically related to the broad term of 'Data Science,' and so expect Projects to increase
											in complexity and scope as time goes on (although that will also be related to how much time I can assign to them).
										</p>
										<p>
											The hope is that by publically commiting in this way I will make exploring public datasets and building stronger
											related skillsets a natural part of my weekly workflow. It will also naturally increase the size of my portfolio,
											and accelerate my learning in this area and involvement in the data science community (hopefully receiving feedback
											on my posts will further improve my methods and quality, although I'll need a new platform for that &mdash; see <a href="blog.html#blog_post_0">Blog Post #0</a>).
										</p>
									</section>
									<p>
										Anyway, it'll be interesting to see how this all goes. Here's to 2016!

											Some thoughts while making this site
										</p>
									</header>
									<a href="blog.html#blog_post_0" class="image featured"><img src="images/html.jpg" alt="html.jpg" title="image source: http://responsiveprocess.com/img/html.jpg"/></a> <!-- source: http://responsiveprocess.com/img/html.jpg -->
									<h3><small> <i> 30/12/15 </i> </small></h3>
									<p>
										Alrighty! Just thought I'd jot down some thoughts while I'm putting together this site.
										I like the theme and layout (thanks <a href="http://html5up.net">HTML5 UP</a>!), however I'm 
										pretty sure I'll be moving to a new platform before too long (Wordpress?). The theme template offers a lot of
										space to put links to posts etc, and for my purposes there's just too much. So I'll have to figure
										out how I want to reformat the layout, although it's given me some ideas.
									</p>
									<p>
										Mainly though it's a bit annoying having to edit multiple html pages when I edit one thing. I'm just using
										a text editor to edit the code directly. So for example, if I change a title of a blog post, 
										I'll have to go to every other page that might reference that post title and edit it accordingly.
										It won't update automatically to match the new title. This is annoying and is likely to lead to mistakes
										and inconsistencies when something is inevitably missed. Also, "Recent Posts" would have to be manually
										updated each time rather than automatically displaying the most recent 5 (say). A view/share/other stats tracker would be
										good to use to establish "Popular Posts", as well as for my own interest.
									</p>
									<p>
										I'd also like increased functionality, such as the ability for people to make comments or share posts, 
										tagging posts and having those be searchable, potentially including things like maths equation rendering,
										and plenty of other things. I don't know if these can all be accomodated easily by using add-ons or 
										some js code, or if it would just be better to use an established platform that includes all these features
										and the automatic updates.
									</p>
									<p>
										I'll probably just use this setup in the meantime &mdash; something is better than nothing &mdash; and try and find
										other people's sites that I like and would meet my needs and see how they've done it.
